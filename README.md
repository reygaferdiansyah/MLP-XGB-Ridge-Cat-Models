## Models

The project includes the following machine learning models:

- Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
- XGBoost
- Ridge Regression
- CatBoost

Each model is implemented in a separate script or notebook for clarity and ease of understanding.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python and pip installed.
2. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/house-price-models.git
    ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd house-price-models
    ```

4. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Explore and run individual model scripts or notebooks based on your preference:

    - MLP Model: `python mlp_model.py` or open `mlp_model.ipynb`
    - XGBoost Model: `python xgb_model.py` or open `xgb_model.ipynb`
    - Ridge Model: `python ridge_model.py` or open `ridge_model.ipynb`
    - CatBoost Model: `python cat_model.py` or open `cat_model.ipynb`

2. Follow the instructions within each script/notebook for data input and model predictions.

## Dataset

Include a brief description of the dataset used or provide a link to the dataset source.
