## Models

The project includes the following machine learning models:

- Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
- XGBoost
- Ridge Regression
- CatBoost

Each model is implemented in a separate script or notebook for clarity and ease of understanding.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python and pip installed.
2. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    gh repo clone reygaferdiansyah/MLP-XGB-Ridge-Cat-Models
    ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd MLP-XGB-Ridge-Cat-Models
    ```

4. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
## Guide to Opening and Copying Code in Google Colab

To save and run the notebook, select the "File" option in the Colab menu and choose "Save" or "Save a copy in Drive" if you want to make a copy in Google Drive.

You can also share the notebook with others or get a link for future access.

By following the steps above, you can easily open, copy, and run code in Google Colab. Be sure to tailor these instructions to the specific needs of your tutorial or project.

## Usage

1. Explore and run individual model scripts or notebooks based on your preference:

    - MLP Model: `python mlp_model.py` or open `mlp_model.ipynb`
    - XGBoost Model: `python xgb_model.py` or open `xgb_model.ipynb`
    - Ridge Model: `python ridge_model.py` or open `ridge_model.ipynb`
    - CatBoost Model: `python cat_model.py` or open `cat_model.ipynb`

2. Follow the instructions within each script/notebook for data input and model predictions.

## Dataset
